# Decision-Trees
## What is the project?


## Concepts
### ReLU Activation


### Softmax Function


## Which programing language and packages did I use?
### Language
Python - It is a high-level, general-purpose language. It has concise and expressive syntax, as well as a powerful standard library. It is suitable for various application development domains, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. In this procject, I used python to accomplish some mechine learning work.

### Packages
numpy - It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

matplotlib - It is a popular library to plot graphs in Python.

tensorflow - It is a popular platform for machine learning.
```
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.activations import linear, relu, sigmoid
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
