# Decision-Trees
## What is the project?
This is a lab that you will implement a decision tree from scratch and apply it to the task of classifying whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous. You will learn knowledge and technologies related to decision tree from this lab.

## Concepts
### Decision-Tree
A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression modeling. Regression is a method used for predictive modeling, so these trees are used to either classify data or predict what will come next.

## Which programing language and packages did I use?
### Language
Python - It is a high-level, general-purpose language. It has concise and expressive syntax, as well as a powerful standard library. It is suitable for various application development domains, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. In this procject, I used python to accomplish some mechine learning work.

### Packages
numpy - It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

matplotlib - It is a popular library to plot graphs in Python.

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Dataset
In this lab, I have one-hot encoded the features. Convert features to 1 or 0 depending on the value.
